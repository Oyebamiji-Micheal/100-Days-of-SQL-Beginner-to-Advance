## Introduction 🚀
<p align="justify">
Consistency they say conquers all things. Thus, I have made it an habit to always learn something every day, no matter how small. In this vein, I joined the <a href="https://github.com/Oyebamiji-Micheal/100-Days-of-LeetCode">100 days of code challenge</a> and completed a few free courses online. To keep up the momentum, my next challenge is to learn SQL from scratch up to an advanced level. The motivation behind this journey is my very friend and role model, <b> Ivuelekwa Stephen, </b> whose coding consistency is absolutely iconic ! 🥺🙏

<a id='why'></a>
## Why MySql and Oracle?
<p align="justify">
I chose to channel my learning towards relational databases, especially MySQL and Oracle due to their popularity and demand. Currently, these two relational database management systems are arguably the most used by data scientists, engineers and analysts. What can I say? I followed the flow 😇

<a id='roadmap'></a>
## Roadmap 📈
<p align="justify">
My first 100 days of code challenge was dedicated to practicing algorithms and data structures. Looking back at this journey, though I have learnt quite a lot, I am not very happy with how it's disorganized. No roadmap or log to track my progress or a strict learning plan. Today, I learn little about recursion, the next day, I'm studying binary search and the next hashmap. It is hard to measure how far I have come. Hence, I think I should follow a different schema and take a more holistic approach to learning SQL. To this end, I have created a roadmap for myself which would be like a guide. The first stage is dedicated to the mastery of MySQL from scratch (Beginner to Intermediate) while the second is dedicated to learning Oracle (Intermediate to Advance) by building on what I've learned during the first stage. Also, I would like to point out that the roadmap is inspired by official documentations of  <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/">MySQL</a> and <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/index.html">Oracle</a>. Lastly, you can find all practice questions and solutions <a href="https://github.com/Oyebamiji-Micheal/SQL-Practice-Questions-and-Answers">here</a>. All learn and no practice they say make a bad data scientist 🙂.</a>
