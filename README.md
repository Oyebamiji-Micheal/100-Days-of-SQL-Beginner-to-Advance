## Introduction 🚀
<p align="justify">
Before I begin, I would like to state the motivation behind this new journey. There are a lot of light green squares on my contribution graph; don't be mistaken, they are not errors or 'useless commits' but my codes and daily progress 
(do well to check 🥺🙏). Consistency they say conquers all things. Thus, I decided to always learn something every day, no matter how small. In this vein, I joined the <a href="https://github.com/Oyebamiji-Micheal/100-Days-of-LeetCode">100 days of code challenge</a> and took a few free courses online. To keep up the momentum, my next challenge is to learn SQL from scratch up to an advanced level. The motivation behind this journey is my very friend and role model, <b> Ivuelekwa Stephen </b>,  whose consistency is absolutely iconic! 
</p>

## Why MySql and Oracle?
<p align="justify">
I chose to channel my learning towards relational databases, especially MySQL and Oracle due to their popularity and demand. Currently, these two databases are arguably the most used by data scientists, engineers and analysts. What can I say? I followed the flow 😇

## Roadmap 📈
<p align="justify">
My first 100 days of code challenge is dedicated to practicing algorithms and data structures. Looking back at this journey, though I have learnt quite a lot, I am not very happy with how it's disorganized. No roadmap or log to track my progress or a strict learning plan. Today, I learn little about recursion, the next day, I'm studying binary search and the next hashmap. It is hard to measure how far I have come. Hence, I think I should follow a different schema and take a more holistic approach to learning SQL. To this end, I have created a roadmap for myself which would be like a guide. The first stage is dedicated to the mastery of MySQL from scratch (Beginner to Intermediate) while the second is dedicated to learning Oracle (Intermediate to Advance) by building on what I've learned during the first stage. Note that while anyone is permitted to use this roadmap, it is not and should be assumed to be an ultimate guide. Also, I would like to point out that the roadmap is inspired by official documentations of  <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/">MySQL</a> and <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/index.html">Oracle</a>. Lastly, all learn and no practice they say make a bad data scientist 🙂. Therefore, I dedicated weekends to practice all I've learned during the week by solving multiple questions on different platforms (all will be documented). Oh! I missed something, Sundays! This will be like a blog post to recap all I've done during the previous week. If you are a beginner at the start of this journey like myself and you wish to use this roadmap or become 'SQL master' in 100 days, please don't hesitate to fork this repository and fire on 🔥

Start Date: 15th of August 2022 🏁
