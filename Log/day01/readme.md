<h1 align="center">100 Days of SQL Beginner to Advance</h1>

# Day 1: Introduction
## What's with your messed-up roadmap bro?
<p align="justify">This is going to be a short introduction to how things will be structured throughout the long run. The first thing I would like to point out is the little confusing roadmap I created as a guide ðŸ˜«. The first week will be about the installation and structure of the language. Hence, there won't be much writing of SQL queries. Also, the roadmap is not exactly in order. For example, it is more feasible to learn how to create a table before learning how to insert data into the table. Therefore, you will most likely see me do kinds of stuff according to my roadmap I'm not supposed to know yet. The point of the roadmap once again is to help me take a more holistic approach to learning the language. Lastly, I would be solving a lot of exercises that might not correlate with my roadmap. This is due to the fact that I'm an 'obsessed learner' traveling extra miles.</p>

## Preface and Legal notice
<p align="justify"> I would like to add this little section I copied from <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/preface.html">MySQL Documentation</a> ðŸ™‚. Since I will be using MySQL 8.0,Â 
"This manual is not intended for use with older versions of the MySQL software due to the many functional and other differences between MySQL 8.0 and previous versions. If you are using an earlier release of the MySQL software, please refer to the appropriate manual. For example, MySQL 5.7 Reference Manual covers the 5.7 series of MySQL software releases."
</p>

## Conclusion
That will be all for today hope it wasn't too bad. Don't be mistaken, this is definitely not all I did today. I blame my roadmap ðŸ˜ª. While you've been reading this, I'm back on my system and I've burst manyÂ things.
