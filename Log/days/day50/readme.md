# 100 Days of SQL Beginner to Advance
## Day 50: More on Joins 

I am now half way into completing this challenge. It has been an interesting journey so far... ðŸ˜Š

For the past couple of days, I've been practicing SQL clauses, functions and so on using the random data I generated. Today, I will practice inner join, left join, right join and other SQL functions and clauses.

For the sake of reference, below are the first four rows of each table...


```student_profile```

|          1 |       141 |    58 | 2022-10-04 16:15:06 |

Since there are hundreds of records in the database, large query result will be limited to 5 rows

**Exercises**

Note: The data is generated in such a way that all students who wrote an exam have a corresponding score.
