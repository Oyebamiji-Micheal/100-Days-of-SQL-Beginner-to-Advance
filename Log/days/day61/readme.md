## Day 61: MySQL in Python I


To get started, I have installed on my windows machine MySQL Workbench, Command Line Client and Server version 8.0. ðŸ™‚

In addition, the following were installed
- mysql==0.0.3
- mysql-connector==2.2.9
- mysql-connector-python==8.0.30
- mysqlclient==2.1.1

The end goal is to learn how to use MySQL along with Python to perform some basic SQL operations which include creating databases and tables with simple constraints, inserting data into tables, fetching data from tables based on certain conditions and so on.

Today, I was able to 
- create a database named `mysql_python_db`
- create two tables, `users` and `tweet_info`, inside the same database 
- and lastly populate the tables with the same data used on the [22nd day](https://github.com/Oyebamiji-Micheal/100-Days-of-SQL-Beginner-to-Advance/blob/master/Log/days/day22/) of this challenge.

Will pick up the pieces tomorrow!
