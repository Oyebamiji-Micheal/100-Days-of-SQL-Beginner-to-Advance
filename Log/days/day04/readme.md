Yesterday, I was able to create and connect to a database. Today, I continued learning how to perform basic operations using SQL. In this vein, I was able to learn the following

1. Use AUTO_INCREMENT with PRIMARY KEY
2. Insert data into a table using INSERT INTO
3. How to show columns using the SELECT keyword
4. Get a specific row using WHERE
5. Specify which table to send certain queries to using the FROM keyword
6. How to update values using the UPDATE keyword along with SET
7. Delete database or tables using DROP

</br>

I also learned how to use keywords like 
>- DEFAULT: Should a column value not be given, a value specified using the DEFAULT argument will be used instead of 'NULL' 
>- AS: Some queries are sometimes long and used as column headers. Aliases are used to format output nicely. Also, we can represent certain values with other words all in the name of simplicity and consistency at least

</br>

Tomorrow, I will push the exercises and queries to this repository.
