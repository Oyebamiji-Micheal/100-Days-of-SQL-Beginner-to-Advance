## Day54: Subqueries

A subquery is simply a `SELECT` statement within another statement. Today, I learned the following concepts about subqueries and correlated subquery...

- A subquery is known as the inner query, and the query that contains subquery is known as the outer query.
  
- Subqueries can be nested within other subqueries. 

- The subqueries provide alternative ways to query the data from the table; otherwise, we need to use complex joins and unions.

- A correlated subquery in MySQL is a subquery that depends on the outer query. It uses the data from the outer query or contains a reference to a parent query that also appears in the outer query. MySQL evaluates it once from each row in the outer query. 

- MySQL Subquery with Comparison Operator

- MySQL Subquery with the IN or NOT-IN Operator

- MySQL ROW Subqueries
