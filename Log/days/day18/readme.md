# Logical Operators with DateTime | Case Statements

So far, I have learned how to use common logical operators such as >, <, <=, >=, AND(&&), OR(||) and so on. Today, I continued the same path and I learned about two new operators, IN and NOT IN. To wrap it up with logical operators, I learned about datatype casting using the CAST function. This is relevant when comparing date and time datatypes.

How `case statements` work is not strange to me given the fact that I have basic knowledge relative to programming languages like Python. Enough of the talking already...

Exercise
Demonstrate the understanding of IN, NOT IN and Case Statements by solving the questions below

- Select all movies that are neither `action` nor `drama` nor `horror`
- Display all movies released in 2011, 2012, 2010, 1960 and 2001
- Using the convention below, add a new column to the existing table
  > - If vote count is less than or equal to 1000, return `low`
  > - If vote count is greater than 1000 but less than 2000, return `medium`
  > - return `high` for vote count greater than or equal to 2000
