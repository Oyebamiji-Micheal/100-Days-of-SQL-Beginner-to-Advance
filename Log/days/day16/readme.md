# Introduction to Logical Operations

For the past few days, I have been learning Date and Time DataType. Not the most interesting topic I would say. Today, I learned about different logical operators in MySQL. In the next couple of days, I will be using the `movies` table created on [day03](https://github.com/Oyebamiji-Micheal/100-Days-of-SQL-Beginner-to-Advance/tree/master/Log/days/day03) to practice the different logical operators I learned. Below are the first four rows of the table........
