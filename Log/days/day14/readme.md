# Arithmetic Expression with Date and Time Datatypes

It's important to note that I'm still using `test_db` as my database and `patients` as table. The SQL file along with its description can be in [here](https://github.com/Oyebamiji-Micheal/100-Days-of-SQL-Beginner-to-Advance/tree/master/Log/days/day10)

Today I learned about `DATEDIFF`, `DATE_ADD`, `DATE_SUB`

## Exercise

Using the above functions, write SQL queries to calculate

- How long ago (days) each patient was vaccinated
- When each patient will receive the second dose of the vaccine. Assume that there's an interval of `one month` between the first and second dose.
