# Day 03: Creating DATABASES and TABLES

I've successfully created and connected to a database named ```movies_db```. Also, I created a table ```movies``` which contains about 22 rows with the following attributes:
>- Title
>- Director
>- Genre
>- Runtime
>- Release Year
>- Vote Count

The data in the table is a subset of [TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata) from Kaggle. It is also worth pointing out that I picked a random genre from each row of the data because most rows contain more than one genre. Also, this dataset will be used to practice various functions in the next few days.Â
