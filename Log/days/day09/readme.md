## Data Types (cont)

Today, I continued learning about data types. Some of the new types I learned today include

- CHAR: Faster for fixed length text and is slightly different from VARCHAR
- DECIMAL(x, y): x represents the precision and y the scale. The precision represents the number of significant digits (both before and after the decimal), and the scale represents the number of digits that can be stored following the decimal point.  
  $1 <= x <= 65$, $1 <= y <= 30$
- FLOAT and DOUBLE

I also covered precision issues associated with FLOAT AND DOUBLE
