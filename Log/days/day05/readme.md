# CRUD operations inÂ MySQL
A couple of days ago, I created a new table, [movies](https://github.com/Oyebamiji-Micheal/100-Days-of-SQL-Beginner-to-Advance/blob/master/Log/days/day03/movies.sql), which contains information such a movie's title, genre, release year and so on. Hence, I am already exposed to creating and inserting data into tables using keywords like CREATE and INSERT INTO. Today, I performed basic CRUD operations by answering a few questions in relation to the data.
